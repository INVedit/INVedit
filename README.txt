INVedit
=======

INVedit is the (more like "some kind of") successor of NBTedit for the game Minecraft, and allows you to edit the player inventory in both single player, and multiplayer if you are the server host

Requirements:
-------------
* You will need the .NET Framework 4.0 (Client Profile) to run this

Features:
---------
* Add, edit and remove enchantments on items
* It is possible to give any item any enchantment with any level
* Edit books; this includes title, author, content and whether it is "signed"
* Loads blocks and items from the enclosed files; this means anyone is able to update INVedit themselves, add items from mods, ETC.
* Groups; for faster access of individual blocks
* Search box lets you filter items
* Displays item damage as bar (if possible)
* Stacks items almost like in the game itself
* Tabs for editing multiple inventories simultaneously
